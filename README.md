Ignore CreateTablesAndData.java it contains the schema of the tables that I created at the start of the project

Ignore Display.java it displays Data from all the tables for production purposes 

Ignore Insert.java it inserts initial 10 records in all the tables

Ignore Desc.java it displays Description of the tables


All these java files are for production purposes and won't be the part of final version

VehicleManagement.java is the Main menu and it is the part of the final project
